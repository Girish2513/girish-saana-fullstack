# Foundations Module — Notes

1. The foundations module reshaped how I think about learning and working as a developer.
   Instead of memorizing concepts, I learned that engineering is built through consistent practice, experimentation, and iteration.
   The biggest mindset shift was understanding that progress comes from trying, breaking things, debugging, and improving daily rather than waiting until everything is fully understood.

2. Setting up a professional development environment taught me the importance of working in a clean, predictable system.
   Using Linux tools and the command line showed me how developers interact with real servers and production environments.
   I learned that mastering the terminal is not optional—it is a core engineering skill.

3. Working with Git and GitHub helped me understand version control as a safety net and collaboration tool rather than just a submission method. Branching, committing, merging, and resolving conflicts demonstrated how real teams manage codebases safely.

4. Shell fundamentals taught me how to navigate, inspect, and manipulate files efficiently.
   Pipes, redirection, and search commands showed how powerful small tools can be when combined.
   Computing basics clarified how processes, permissions, users, and ports work internally, which helped me understand why servers fail, scripts don’t run, or ports become busy.

5. Setting up a cloud virtual machine was one of the most important lessons because it showed me that deploying software means working on remote machines, not just local computers.
   Connecting through SSH, installing services, and running servers helped me see how infrastructure actually works.

6. Overall, this module built my operational foundation as a developer.
   I now understand not just how to write code, but how code runs, how systems execute it, and how engineers manage real environments.
   The key takeaway is that strong fundamentals in tools, systems, and workflow habits make learning advanced technologies much easier and more practical.

## Personal Goal:

Continue strengthening system-level understanding so I can confidently build, deploy, and debug real-world applications independently.
